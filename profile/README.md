## üöÄ Overview
HistoryHound is a powerful personal-web search tool for macOS that lets you search through the full contents of all web pages you've visited (history), all bookmarks, and even RSS feeds‚Äîinstantly. Rather than trying to remember which browser or which day you saw something, HistoryHound indexes your online activity and makes it searchable by keywords, phrases, or filters.  

Designed for users who browse across multiple browsers or devices, HistoryHound gathers entries from Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, NetNewsWire, and others. Even when the browser‚Äôs own history viewer can‚Äôt find a page because you forgot the title, HistoryHound can locate it based on what you *remember from the content*. It‚Äôs like Spotlight but for your web past‚Äîfast, smart, and always listening.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About (Deep Dive)
There are many tools for bookmarks or browser history, but very few that let you search *inside page content*, across multiple browsers, reliably and with control. HistoryHound focuses on giving you that depth and control:

- **Full Content Indexing**  
  Not only page titles and URLs, but the actual text of the page is indexed. So you can search for phrases or even words inside articles, blog posts, forums, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

- **Bookmarks, History & RSS Support**  
  It doesn‚Äôt just wait for you to bookmark something‚Äîit tracks history and RSS feeds so even pages you visited but didn‚Äôt bookmark are searchable. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- **Multiple Browsers, Unified Search**  
  Supports Safari, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, Brave, Vivaldi, NetNewsWire, URL Manager Pro, and more. No more jumping between browsers trying to remember where you saw something. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

- **Flexible Filtering & Search Modes**  
  You can include/exclude domains or URL patterns; search by date; use boolean and phrase searches; limit to bookmarks or history only. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

- **Hot-key & Palette Mode**  
  Call up HistoryHound with a keyboard shortcut, or use its lightweight search palette so it doesn‚Äôt overwhelm your workspace. Quick access when you need it. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

- **Privacy & Control**  
  The index can be restricted; you can exclude pages or domains; you decide how long pages are remembered. Your usage remains under your control. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

- **Regular Updates & Compatibility**  
  Runs natively on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. Compatible with recent macOS versions, supports the latest browsers. The index and feature set is maintained. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
